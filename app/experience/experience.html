        <h4>Intern Software Developer (June-August 2014)</h4>
        <p>
           
          There were two parts to my internship. I started out as an intern learning front-end technologies such as AngularJS and NodeJS.
          The second part consisted of converting features from a Delphi application into a modern web application. The application we wrote
          was a configurator where the user selected a product and would see selections based on whatever has already been selected and what 
          product is being selected.

        <h4>Part-time Software Developer (August 2014 - June 2015)</h4>
        <p>
           
          This part of my career I was working part-time for Oasis Digital. This taught me to balance my time wisely between school and work.
          I started out maintaining the previous project and leading the other interns on
          the project. 
          I quickly found myself bored because of how much I already knew about the project. Due to this, I was put on a project using a framework called Java Spring. 
          This was one of the most important parts of my career. Working on a prototype is very different from working on a full-fledged client 
          project. My job for the application was to work on the front-end and also work on a new demo data generator. This was a generator written
          in Java.

        <h4>Intern Team Leader / Project Lead (June 2015 - )</h4>
        <p>
          After graduating High School, I was promoted to the Intern Team Leader. My job was to run the intern program and manage my own team. It was my
          responsibility to ensure that the new interns gained the knowledge needed for future edprojects.
          I started out teaching front-end web development for about 4-7 hours a day. This included HTML & CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, AngularJS, NodeJS,
          dependency management and much more.
          Later that summer, I was assigned as a project lead for an application for the Saint Louis Science Center.
          The application was to go hand-in-hand with the new Agriculture exhibit. The guests would be able to pull up the application and see whatever was
          physically in the gallery. The point of the project was to make the experience more interactive. So when the guest went to the app a map would
          appear with a set of markers and each marker would represent some media. Each media would have tags/attributes associated with the media and as you
          filter the attributes, more/less markers would appear on the map.
          Another side of the application was the admin side. The admin side would guide the user experience. Everything the guest would see is due to the options
          on the admin part. 
          We ended up finishing the prototype and now is the phase to move into production and integrating it closer into the exhibit.
          Some technologies we used were JIRA, HTML & CSS, JavaScript, AngularJS, NodeJS, GulpJS and Firebase.

        <p>
          I have been a Google Play Developer for 2 years. It originated with SIMON.
          Initially this started as a project to learn more about Java and Artificial Intelligence.
          This was very important to me because it was the first dream I ever had. It was also when I realized I wanted
          to increase my programming knowledge. It inspired me because it's when I realized that I could do whatever I wanted
          just by typing some lines of code. This is why I want to study Computer Science; so that I can solve the world's problems 
          through technology at a fast pace.
          Eventually SIMON evolved into a native Android Application that took actions based on voice-input. Some features included
          opening apps, texting other people, and computing calculations. I also recently achieved 100+ downloads on the application.

        <h4>Article-Summarizer</h4>
        <p>
           
          Hackathon culture is amazing. Taking a day or two just to hash out an idea and learn some cool stuff is awesome. I attended
          one of my first hackathons last winter. We realized that we needed to do more than just a small Android app. I realized that
          most people have social networks, but don't read the content because it's so long. We decided to change the entire social network
          experience by creating a summarizer application. It would take text and find which sentences were most important.
          We wrote a custom algorithm that took ranked sentences based on the frequency of specific words and how they matched with the title.
          This was when my team won the award for "The Best Application" at the hackathon.
