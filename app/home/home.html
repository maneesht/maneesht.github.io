    <h4>About</h4>
    <p>
      I am a Computer Science major at Purdue University who is eager to get some more experience.
      I started out programming in Java/C++. I steadily learned more and more about Web Programming 
      and ended up with an internship before graduating high school. This was when I found that I could
      really make a career out of something incredible.
      I found my love in programming when I realized how easy it was to make your dream a reality
      through code. Every day more solutions to problems are realized through something as simple as
      writing up code on a computer. 
      This site was written to showcase my enthusiasm and love for technology.
      Besides programming, I love Mock Trial, Taekwondo (2nd Dan Black Belt) and Tennis and was on top JV last year.
      I am extremely excited to learn new programming concepts and ideas.
